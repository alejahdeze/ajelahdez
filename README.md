### Hi, I’m Alejandra 👋

Researcher and simulation engineer working on solid and fluid mechanics.  
I like turning complex ideas into clear, usable tools. I’ve worked extensively with tools like **COMSOL, OpenFOAM, MATLAB, Python, and LaTeX**, and I care about **clean formulations, physical intuition, and reproducible workflows**. 

I believe in kindness! 🤗
